# sbib-bot
A Discord bot designed to manage a text adventure game. It also has a silly 8-ball function packaged as a slash command.

This bot uses the [D++ library](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP). I run it on [replit](https://replit.com/), and D++'s docs [explain how to deploy in the same way](https://dpp.dev/building-a-cpp-discord-bot-in-repl.html) if you want to mess around with it without too much fuss or dependency management.
